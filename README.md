## Overview

My solution to the FrontendMentor challenge. Only some minor changes by me in the hover state.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Just really trying to go about it piece by piece. Get in the habit of building to the design and implementing the designers vision.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned more about border-radius specifically:

`.element {
  border-bottom-left-radius: 100% 50%;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 100% 50%;
  }`

To create the slight curve on the page

Just continuing to improve and build confidence on my HTML, CSS skills while building a site to specific designs

### Continued development

Want to continue to improve building sites, working with SaSS, with JS
